        <p class="lead mb-4">Hard-Working and focused student who is motivated to work as well as accomplish his tasks professionally. I am determined to always stay out of my comfort zone as well as pursue excellency in all fields of work and study on a daily basis. I acquire satisfaction from staying on the tip of of my feet as well as helping lines of employees or customers to acquire a sincere amount of satisfaction no matter the work.I enjoy many lines of leisure as well from playing basketball and volleyball to collecting and selling sneakers that have value and lines of profit. Lipton, R., Banerjee, A., Dowling, K. C., & Treno, A. J. (2005). The Geography of COPD Hospitalization in California. COPD: Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, 2(4), 435â€“444. https://doi.org/10.1080/15412550500346543 <br><br>

        I worked at Kaiser Permenante for roughly a year and a half being a front desk clerk. This managed my job to focus on patients to walk in through the hospital as well as manage any call or duty to the front hospital. Often times I had to call security for backup or asist patients on their wheelchair to their destination in the hospital. This job offered me alot of opportunties in muy life, one of which was to purse the medical field that I'm working hard at to get accepted into. I also worked at Parts Tech which was a front desk management at a car business that guided me to business and managenment skills. The communication aspect in a business I feel is very much crucial in today's line of work because it showed me the importance of social skills as well as adapting those skills to customers can be so important. <br><br>

        I also volunteered at many different mosque locations to support my religious culture of Islam. Unfortunately, this religion is not as populated in Southern California as it seems and my goal was to reach out to other religions as well to educate them that Islam is indeed a peaceful faith and has no correlation with what residents see on their television. I also volunteered at my local public library in Corona, California which guided me to gain knowledge upon books, movies, and magazines as well as the importance of these works in today's world.
